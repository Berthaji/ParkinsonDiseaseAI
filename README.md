# ParkinsonDiseaseAI

The goal of this project is to test the performances of ResNet18 and MobileNetV2 models on the recognition of Parkinson's disease by evaluating drawings from both patients and healthy people. In practice, the models learn features from both the parkinsonian drawings—that have some irregularities due to the altered motor skills of the patients—and the drawings from the healthy group, gaining the capacity to spot small differences in the lines of the drawings.
This kind of analysis gives a contribution to obtain an early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with a non-invasive method.

Dataset used: Parkinson's Drawings (available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/parkinsons-drawings)
